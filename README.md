# v-js

Run `npm start` in `/server`

## API

The api is at `/api/` and all the endpoints are private, just access it via a browser to easily enter the http auth. There is no front-end to register users but the app does use proper authentication and user data from it's database, so for testing purposes the available user is :

`{username: "admin", password: "celinedion"}`
